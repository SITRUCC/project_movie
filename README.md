PHASE ONE MOVIE-DATA PROJECT

Description: The project below has done analysis of data sets in order to help the new Head of Microsoft have a guideline of how the movie industry operates, how much revenue is generated, which movie studios are succeeding and what kind of genres do the target audience enjoy. The programming language used is python and with the help of libraries like pandas that help in data analysis(which entailed data cleaning, handling missing data etc.), matplotlib and seaborne that help in presenting the data analysis in graphs for enabling presentations. The challenges I faced during this project that I would like to be able to tackle in the future are: • Web scraping data from idmb website in order to be able to fill the missing values in the datasets. • Being able to handle the outliers in the datasets.

How to install and run the project: The steps to be taken in order to install and run the project in one’s terminal:  One forks the project into their own repository.  One open their terminal and navigates to the desired folder they want their work to be stored.  One goes back to GitHub where they had forked the project in their repository and then copies the url.  When you have copied the url u go back to terminal and writes ‘git clone + the pasted url’  Then one presses enter and the project will be stored in their computer.

How to use the project: The project has been well detailed thus only one should just be careful in changing variables due to some functions already set which will bring errors.

Credits: I want to thank free code camp for providing materials and tutorials that I followed as to come up with the some of the data analysis that is within the project.
